# Data Structures in Python

Welcome to my repository on data structures implemented in Python. This repository currently includes implementations for the following data structures:

- Stack

## Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added and removed only from the top of the stack.

### Advantages of Stack

- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to implement using arrays or linked lists.
- **Memory Management**: Helps in managing function calls and local variables in programming languages.
- **Reversibility**: Useful for reversing data and undo mechanisms in applications.

### Disadvantages of Stack

- **Limited Access**: Only the top element can be accessed, which limits flexibility.
- **Overflow and Underflow**: Risks of stack overflow and underflow if not managed properly.

## Queue

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### Advantages of Queue

- **Order Preservation**: Maintains the order of elements, making it useful for scheduling tasks.
- **Parallel Processing**: Useful in scenarios like breadth-first search in graphs, handling requests in web servers, etc.

### Disadvantages of Queue

- **Limited Access**: Only the front and rear elements can be accessed, which can be restrictive.
- **Potential Inefficiency**: If implemented with arrays, shifting elements can be inefficient.

## Linked List

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next node in the sequence.

### Advantages of Linked List

- **Dynamic Size**: Can easily grow and shrink in size by allocating and deallocating memory.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Insertions and deletions are more efficient compared to arrays since no shifting is required.

### Disadvantages of Linked List

- **Memory Overhead**: Requires extra memory for storing pointers, which can add overhead.
- **Sequential Access**: Accessing elements requires traversing the list from the beginning, which can be slower than array indexing.

## Future Plans

- Implement other data structures like Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, etc.
- Add detailed usage examples and applications for each data structure.
- Optimize the current implementations for performance.
